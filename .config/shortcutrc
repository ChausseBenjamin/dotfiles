# #---Universal Shortcut Configuration File---# #
# This file aims to provide a simple way to configure
# universal shortcuts for your system. Treat it in the
# following way:
#  - Lines starting with '#' and empty are ignored
#  - Everything else is treated as a 3 column comma separated csv
#  - Commas can be escaped with a backslash
#  - columns 2 and 3 should not contain spaces
# Columns are as follows (left to right):
#  1. Name of the shortcut (for display purposes in certain programs)
#  2. The shortcut itself
#  3. The path to the directory
# Here are examples of how I use this file with my shell:
# - uppercase shortcuts prepended by 'G' are ENV variables to these paths
# - lowercase shortcuts prepended by 'g' are aliases to these paths
# Here are examples of how I use this file with my file manager (lf):
# - lowercase shortcuts prepended by 'g' go to these paths
# - lowercase shortcuts prepended by 'y' copies selected files to these paths
# - lowercase shortcuts prepended by 'm' moves selected files to these paths
