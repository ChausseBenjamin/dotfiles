# These are my personal configs on top of mutt-wizard.
# Add the following line to your muttrc to have them:
# source $HOME/.config/mutt/goobook

# GOOBOOK:
# goobook let's you query google for contact information.
# You install it with pip: pip install --user goobook
set query_command="goobook query %s"
# Note that if you use an old version of mutt-wizard,
# you will need to disable abook in it's script:
# sed -i "s/^set\squery_command.*$//" /usr/share/mutt-wizard/mutt-wizard.muttrc

# PGP Encryption:
# I want pgp encryption by default when possible.
# The following line makes this possible:
set crypt_use_gpgme=yes
set crypt_autosign

# vim: filetype=neomuttrc
