# Usage: dropbox-exclude <initial-path>
# This script is meant to be run within a file manager such as lf or ranger.
# When in a directory, you can view which files are not being synced by Dropbox
# as a dmenu prompt. You can then select a file to start syncing that file again.
# For readability, the script will only show files in the current directory.
# If you want to see all excluded files in the Dropbox directory, you can use the
# `dropbox-cli exclude list` command.

# if $1 is a file, get the directory of the file
# if $1 is a directory, use it as the directory
# exit if something else
if [ -d "$1" ]; then
	cd "$1" || exit 1
elif [ -f "$1" ]; then
	cd "$(dirname "$1")" || exit 1

	exit 1
