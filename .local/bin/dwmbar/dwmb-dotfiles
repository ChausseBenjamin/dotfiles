# This block aims to never show up (to be out of sight, out of mind)
# If the following situation occurs, the following icons will be shown:
#
# -  : There are uncommitted changes
# -  : There are staged changes
# -  : Unpushed changes
# -  : Upstream has changes that are not pulled
#
# These icons will sit next the this block's base icon
#
# Only one icon will be shown at a time, and the order of priority is:
# uncommitted > staged > unpushed > upstream
