# Usage:
# This script prints a battery icon and percentage charge.
# If charging, it will show a charging icon instead of a battery
#
# By default, it will show the first battery found.
# If you have multiple batteries, you can specify the battery as an argument to this script.
#
# Example:
# $ dwmb-battery BAT1
#  󱐋 86%

#  00-19%
#  20-39%
#  40-59%
#  60-79%
#  80-100%
# 󱐋 or  charging

[ ! -d "$bat" ] && echo "No battery found." && exit 1

status=$(cat "$bat"/status)
capacity=$(cat "$bat"/capacity)

# for debugging, $2 is the percentage to print
[ -n "$2" ] && capacity=$2

# If the battery is not charging, evaluate its current charge and print an icon accordingly

	[8-9][0-9] | 100) icon=" " ;;
